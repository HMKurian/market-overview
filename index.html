          <h1>The beginning of Stock Market</h1>

          <p>An overview of how the stock market started</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="right-side">

        <div class="card card1">
          <p> On May 17, 1792, outside of 68 Wall Street under a Buttonwood tree, twenty-four stockbrokers and merchants
            from New York City signed the Buttonwood Agreement, thus founding the New York Stock Exchange. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card card2">
          <p> The fleets of ships being employed needed to be supported in order for the great shipping nations of
            Europe to explore and discover new lands. Business owners provided the funding. Merchants started to band
            together to form a firm that funded their own enterprise rather than just lending the money and trading the
            bonds to lower the risk. They were the very first venture capitalists, in a sense. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card card3">
          <p>A new corporation would initially be created for each voyage and then be dissolved when the fleet arrived
            back in port. As the process progressed, new commercial endeavors would be funded by the same firm with the
            same jointly held stock (thus joint-stock corporation), owned by the same merchant adventurers. Many
            businesses prospered, and the stock of those businesses rose in value and popularity.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card card4">
          <p>Shares of stock could be traded rather than purchased for cash. Merchants would spread their risk by
            trading stocks in one business venture for equities in another because not every ship would return to port
            with cargo ready for sale.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card card5">
          <p>The Stock Market is more than 400 years old. The first international firm was the Dutch East India Company,
            founded in 1602. It was the first business to issue stocks and is the forefather of all modern businesses.
            Because the directors of the corporation controlled it, shareholders had little power however, they received
            a generous annual return of 16% in the first half of 17th century.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card card6">
          <p>Instead of assets, the early trades were for debts. The expeditions and battles that medieval kings and
            crusading lords fought required financial support. By selling a portion of the debt to other merchants in
            exchange for a portion of the profits made when the debts were repaid with interest, they were able to
            obtain the funds from affluent merchants. These debt trades are referred to as "bond markets" today.</p>
